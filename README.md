This project implements class-based views (CBVs) in Django to provide a structured and scalable approach to managing books. Using Django’s built-in generic views, the application efficiently handles CRUD operations—creating, reading, updating, and deleting book records.

Features:
Homepage (HomeView) Displays a basic message and handles simple user interactions via GET and POST requests.

List View (BookListView) Retrieves and displays all books stored in the database. Uses Django’s ListView to streamline data querying.

Detail View (BookDetailView) Provides detailed information about a specific book using Django’s DetailView, ensuring clean and structured routing.

Create View (BookCreateView) Allows users to add new books. Uses Django’s CreateView to dynamically generate forms based on model fields.

Update View (BookUpdateView) Provides an editable form for modifying existing book details, ensuring efficient content management.

Delete View (BookDeleteView) Displays a confirmation page before securely removing a book entry from the database.

Technical Highlights:
Uses Django’s generic class-based views to minimize redundant code and improve scalability.

Structured URL patterns to support clean navigation (book/<int:pk>/, book/create/, book/update/<int:pk>/).

Includes a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files and ensure a clean repository.

Pushes code to GitHub, allowing version control and collaboration.

This project demonstrates a well-structured approach to Django development, aligning with best practices for maintainability and scalability. Since you focus on clarity and structured learning, adding pagination or authentication could further refine the system!
